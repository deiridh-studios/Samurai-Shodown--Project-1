## Usage

To make one of the first group, we will use the control lever or joystick. You can control the character movement: go right
or go left, jump, crouch, etc. With these movements you can also use dash using the "BAKUFU BLITZ" (shifting the joystick
twice forward quickly) or the "FLYING RETREAT" (shifting backwards), you can also guard if you move your character back 
when the enemy is hitting you. You can run to an enemy too if you push twice the direction of a movement an keep the button
pushed, if you make any strike when you are running you will charge against the enemy.


Then, when we talk about the fighting movements we have two types of them:

Slash (or hit when you are unarmed): you can use a weak attack with your weapon if you push A, a strong attack pushing B 
or a much powerful attack with your weapon if you press the two buttons at the same time.
Kick: the kick attack will not hurt the enemy as much as a weapon attack but maybe you will want to use it if you are 
unarmed or your adversary is out of range for your weapon. Like the slash attack you can spot differents intensities in 
your kick, using C you make a weak attack, with D you can add a some intensity into your kick and finally if you want to 
throw a powerful attack, you can use twice buttons at the same time.
