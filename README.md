# Samurai Shodown

We are Deiridh Studios, one group of forming students from CITM UPC University, in Terrassa. As our first project we are 
recrating "Samurai Shodown", a fighting game from 1993. We are  developing this game as a main coursework in the "Project 
Development" subject.

In the next link you will find all the game information and documentation in the project's wiki:

3. Enjoy it!

## Usage

In the latest version of the game you will be able to play only with the keyboard, but you can play with a friend because the two characters can be controlled.

Player 1: 
- Character movements will be controlled with: A as left, D as right, W as jump and S for crouch.
- Character actions will be done using: T is used for punch or slash(it depends if the character wields a weapon), and you can use Y for kick the oponent.

Player 2: 
- Character movements will be controlled with: left direction, right direction, up as jump and down for crouch.
- Character actions will be done using: H is used for punch or slash(it depends if the character wields a weapon), and you can use G for kick the oponent.

You can combine differents keys to make differents movements as crouch-kick or crouch-slash, jumping-kick or jumping-slash and any action during the movement of the character.

Finally your character has an extra ablity that will throw an special attack: this can be used with the combo crouch, crouch+move forward and move forward+punch.


## History

Release history: 
- Almost done, V0.99:
    Version 0 of the game. It just shows the stage where the fighters will be interacting and allows the user move the chamera with directions left and right of the keyboard. We also added some musics but we experimented some problems with them too.
    
- Four scenes with Haohmaru, v0.2:
    In this version we already put two scenes(only image) that work as a welcome page and a end page. Ingame we added a stage, you can change form the first stage to the second using a key(space). We also added the character Haohmaru from the game and allowed the user to move freely, realize jumps and use some basic movements(kick and strike). The music is fixed.
    
- 2nd player, v0.28:
    The second character has been added in this version and can be played at the same time as the other, move freely and realize the same basic moves. There is no collisions between them and we experimented some problems with the camera movement to follow the two characters at the same time(zoom in and zoom out will be added in a future version). 
    

- Tornado and collisions, V0.38:
    In this version both characters have colliders that the user can see, but these are not working with the movements of the character only if they touch each other when they move left or right. We already have the hitted animation and we added an special attack for the first character(left). We have some problems with the sprites of the special movement and with it particles they work slow and the character turns smaller than it should be.
    

- Fix animations, V0.39:
    This was a improvements with the sprites and movements of both characters, fixing times and sprites order.
	

- Timer, V0.42:
    Now with the timer added you will have tu hurry up if you want to end the life's oponent before the time ends, when it does the battle will be ended and the final scene will appear to congratulate the players.
