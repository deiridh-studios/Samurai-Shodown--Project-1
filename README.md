# Samurai Shodown

We are Deiridh Studios, one group of forming students from CITM UPC University, in Terrassa. As our first project we are 
recrating "Samurai Shodown", a fighting game from 1993. We are  developing this game as a main coursework in the "Project 
Development" subject.

In the next link you will find all the game information and documentation in the project's wiki:

## Installation

1. Download the last zip document in the github release page.
2. Inside the zip search and open the exe, you will be able to play the game now.
3. Enjoy it!

## Usage

To make one of the first group, we will use the control lever or joystick. You can control the character movement: go right
or go left, jump, crouch, etc. With these movements you can also use dash using the "BAKUFU BLITZ" (shifting the joystick
twice forward quickly) or the "FLYING RETREAT" (shifting backwards), you can also guard if you move your character back 
when the enemy is hitting you. You can run to an enemy too if you push twice the direction of a movement an keep the button
pushed, if you make any strike when you are running you will charge against the enemy.


Then, when we talk about the fighting movements we have two types of them:

Slash (or hit when you are unarmed): you can use a weak attack with your weapon if you push A, a strong attack pushing B 
or a much powerful attack with your weapon if you press the two buttons at the same time.
Kick: the kick attack will not hurt the enemy as much as a weapon attack but maybe you will want to use it if you are 
unarmed or your adversary is out of range for your weapon. Like the slash attack you can spot differents intensities in 
your kick, using C you make a weak attack, with D you can add a some intensity into your kick and finally if you want to 
throw a powerful attack, you can use twice buttons at the same time.


## History

Release history: 
- Almost done, V0.99:
    Version 0 of the game. It just shows the stage where the fighters will be interacting and allows the user move the chamera with directions left and right of the keyboard. We also added some musics but we experimented some problems with them too.
    
- Four scenes with Haohmaru, v0.2:
    In this version we already put two scenes(only image) that work as a welcome page and a end page. Ingame we added a stage, you can change form the first stage to the second using a key(space). We also added the character Haohmaru from the game and allowed the user to move freely, realize jumps and use some basic movements(kick and strike). The music is fixed.
    
- 2nd player, v0.28:
    The second character has been added in this version and can be played at the same time as the other, move freely and realize the same basic moves. There is no collisions between them and we experimented some problems with the camera movement to follow the two characters at the same time(zoom in and zoom out will be added in a future version). 
    

- Tornado and collisions, V0.38:
    In this version both characters have colliders that the user can see, but these are not working with the movements of the character only if they touch each other when they move left or right. We already have the hitted animation and we added an special attack for the first character(left). We have some problems with the sprites of the special movement and with it particles they work slow and the character turns smaller than it should be.
    

- Fix animations(changes on the sprites and animations).


- Timer(timer implemented during de battle and scene change when it ends).




Samurai Shodown is the first game of this series from SNK, released in 1993, becoming really popular and a total success. 
It can be played in different platforms such as Neo Geo, Neo-Geo CD, SNES and Gameboy.

It is a versus fighting game set in the late 18th century. Considered to be the first 2D weapons fighter, with a big 
variety of characters from around the world and with different stories behind them.

The story of the game goes around Ambrosia, the god of darkness, who wants to spread chaos and revives Amakusa as a demon.
Amakusa, then steals the “Palenque” stone from Green Hell to bring Ambrosia to the living world. So the objective of the 
game is, through a tournament, defeat the most powerful fighters in the world in order to arrive to Amakusa and stop him be
fore he achieves to revive Ambrosia who with all his power will rule the world.
