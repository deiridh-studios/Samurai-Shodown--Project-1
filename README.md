## History

Release history: 
- Almost done, V0.99:
    Version 0 of the game. It just shows the stage where the fighters will be interacting and allows the user move the chamera with directions left and right of the keyboard. We also added some musics but we experimented some problems with them too.
    
- Four scenes with Haohmaru, v0.2:
    In this version we already put two scenes(only image) that work as a welcome page and a end page. Ingame we added a stage, you can change form the first stage to the second using a key(space). We also added the character Haohmaru from the game and allowed the user to move freely, realize jumps and use some basic movements(kick and strike). The music is fixed.
    
- 2nd player, v0.28:
    The second character has been added in this version and can be played at the same time as the other, move freely and realize the same basic moves. There is no collisions between them and we experimented some problems with the camera movement to follow the two characters at the same time(zoom in and zoom out will be added in a future version). 
    

- Tornado and collisions, V0.38:
    In this version both characters have colliders that the user can see, but these are not working with the movements of the character only if they touch each other when they move left or right. We already have the hitted animation and we added an special attack for the first character(left). We have some problems with the sprites of the special movement and with it particles they work slow and the character turns smaller than it should be.
    

- Fix animations, V0.39:
    This was a improvements with the sprites and movements of both characters, fixing times and sprites order.
	

- Timer, V0.42:
    Now with the timer added you will have tu hurry up if you want to end the life's oponent before the time ends, when it does the battle will be ended and the final scene will appear to congratulate the players. 

-Samurai Shodown, v0.5:
    This is an almost all new version of the game, we are developing the game with a new map and player, so this version includes the new player spriteshits and animation as the new map.

-Samurai Shodown, v0.55:
    For first time gamed is implemented and fullscreen ukyo stage with the two Ukyo players. In this versions the movement in battle is widely limited with just the capacit of movement right and left.

-Samurai Shodown, v0.58:
    Now you are able to make some new moves using your gamepad like jump, crouch and some attack movements.

-Samurai Shodown, v0.6:
    This time the gamepad is allowed to control the player and you can use it for the movements tha are implemented in game for the moment. We have added some new mechanics or special effects like slowdown camera or the zoom out.

-Samurai Shodown, v0.63:
    This time the almost finished version of Saurai Shodown includes new features in the UI, the character selection screen but only allows to play with one player, you can see the others players too but no select any of them. Finally we have included the winning and lose modules for the battles.
